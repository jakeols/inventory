Polism
======
A small open source inventory management system I just began developing. Built in PHP using <a href="https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap">Codeigniter-Bootstrap</a><br>
<h2> Stuff that needs to be done</h2>
-Change it so that you can type in quantity sold, and have that automatically subtracted rather than having to type in the new quantity.<br>
-Dashboard Page: I still need to pick a JS library for this.
