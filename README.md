-Download zip file and unpack it<br>
-Open the 'Database.sql' file, copy it, and run it as a query.<br>
-Edit the 'database.php' file and put in your database information.<br>
-Go to http://www.(yourwebsite)/Polism/index.php/auth/login and login. The default login is username: "admin" password: "password"<br>
-If you would like to create additional login accounts, go to http://www.(yourwebsite)/Polism/index.php/auth/create_user *Note: You must be logged in as admin to use this feature.<br>
