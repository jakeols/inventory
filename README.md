Polism
======
A small open source inventory management system I just began developing. Built in PHP using <a href="https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap">Codeigniter-Bootstrap</a><br>
<h2> Stuff that needs to be done</h2>
-Change it so that you can type in quantity sold, and have that automatically subtracted rather than having to type in the new quantity.<br>
-Dashboard Page: I still need to pick a JS library for this. 

<h2>How to Install</h2>
-Download zip file and unpack it<br>
-Open the 'Database.sql' file, copy it, and run it as a query.<br>
-Edit the 'database.php' file and put in your database information.<br>
-Go to http://www.(yourwebsite)/Polism/index.php/auth/login and login. The default login is username: "admin" password: "password"<br>
-If you would like to create additional login accounts, go to http://www.(yourwebsite)/Polism/index.php/auth/create_user *Note: You must be logged in as admin to use this feature.<br>
<br>

Polism is still under rapid development.
